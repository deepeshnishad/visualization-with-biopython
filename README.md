# visualization-with-biopython
To manage biological sequencing data kept in FASTA, PDB (Protein Data Bank), and XML formats, we will use Biopython. We will investigate and develop an interactive three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of the SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) protein structures using this sequence data.

## DATA SOURCE
Data was downloaded from NCBI in FASTA file format and comprises genetic information (National Center for Biotechnology Information).

### Summary Of Findings
•Sequence length: 29,903 base pairs
•GC content: 37.97%
•Protein content has high Leucine L and Serine S.
•The largest protein is of length 2,701 amino acid.
•Largest protein BLAST results corresponds to SARS-CoV-19 6YYT.
•Protein 6YYT has 8 chains & a RNA binding domain.
